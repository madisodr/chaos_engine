# Chaos Engine

Chaos Engine is a LED framework built to be used with an Arduino (or equivilent) and a 1D led strip.

It heavily utilizes the FastLED library.

# Longboard Code

Unmaintained. Need to migrate it over to using the Chaos Engine. Need to make the Chaos Engine easily included like a
library first.
